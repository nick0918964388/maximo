Problem
Maximo login screen displays error message after a user logs out and try to log back in again within one minute after installing Maximo feature pack 7.6.0.8,

Symptom
Message:

The LTPA token that is used to login is invalid. LTPA tokens are used for the login process when WebSphere Application 
Server Security is enabled. Wait a few seconds and then try again to login. If the problem persists, 
clear your browser cookies or restart the browser.

Resolving The Problem
Beginning with Maximo 7.6.0.8, the default behavior is to prevent a user login within one minute of the user logging out. 
This is intentional.  It addresses a LTPA-token related security exposure.

For clients who use SSL, the exposure is restricted to the local server only. 
If the restricted risk is acceptable, go to the System Properties application, 
change the value of system property mxe.ltpatoken.kill from to 0, 
and select the property and click Live Refresh. Disabling mxe.ltpatoken.kill permits 
users to log in to Maximo again immediately after logout.
